A crossplatform web application to make event searching easy for busy college students. The app is designed specifically centered around Wesleyan University’s 
campus and is equipped with a host of features that every event app should consist of. 

This was my first attempt to building a comprehensive product for fun and i've got to say, I've learned a great deal out of this experinece. 

# Things I learned
- Taking advantage of mobile device's native functionality using Cordova
    - Sharing via instagram, messenger, and sms. 
    - Haptic Feedback
    - Camera Functionality
    - Calendar Invites
- Using Firebase Collections to store data with data best practices in mind
- Learned to make common front-end design patterns from popular app like Fandango and Facebook come to life.
